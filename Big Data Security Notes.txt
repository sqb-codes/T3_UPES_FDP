Secure Distributed Systems

Threat Categories
- External Threats - Attack originated from external sources like hacking, malware
- Internal Threats - Malicious insiders or unintentional breaches like privilege misuse
- Advanced Persistent Threats


Threat and Risk Assessment
1. Identify Threat
2. Analyze Vulnerabilities
3. Evaluate Risks
4. Mitigation Strategies


Kerberos
- Prevents unauthorized access by authenticating clients and services

Kerberos Workflow
1. Authentication Request - Client sends a request to Authentication server (AS)
2. Ticket Granting Ticket - AS issues a TGT to client
3. Service Request - Client uses the TGT to request access to a specific service from TGT
4. Service Access - Client receives a service Ticket and accesses the resource

MIT Kerberos
- Implementation of Kerberos protocol, mainly used in distributed systems for secure authentication


Sentry Service
- Provides fine-grained authorization for data in distributed systems

Sentry Privilege models
- RBAC - Role based access control
  - Privileges - Permission granted to a role
  - Roles - Assigned to users or groups
  - Resources - Databases, tables (Objects being accessed)


Data Protection in Distributed Environments

Integrity of Ingested Data
- Ensure that ingested data is complete, unaltered and authentic

2 methods to check integrity
- Checksum validation - verify the data integrity during transmission
- Hashing Algorithm - SHA, MD5 for integrity verification


Data Ingest Confidentiality
- Protecting sensitive data
  - Authentication
  - Encryption


Encryption Algorithms
- Symmetric - Same key for encryption and decryption (AES, DES)
- Asymmetric - Public and Private key pair (RSA)


Encryption Data at Rest
- Full-disk encryption
- File-level encryption
- Transparent Data Encryption


Encrypting Data in Transit
- TLS/SSL - Secure communication between endpoints
- VPNs - Encrypted tunnels for network communications
